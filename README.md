# Curve-Fitting-Dashboard

In this mini-project, I created a dashboard that allows the user to input (x y) points, select the type of regression in a dropdown list and plot the resulting fitting curve. A section with the evaluation metrics (R Squared, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error) and the model equation will also update accordingly.

To create this dashboard app, I used Plotly (https://plotly.com/python/), which is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python.
